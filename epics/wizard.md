## The Quest

### Part 1: [Staff of Gabstik](/item/14339)

1. To start your Epic journey, head to [Temple of Solusek Ro](/zone/80) and find [Solomen](/npc/80023) (+425, +80). He is on the second floor. The easiest way to get to him is to go to the back of the zone until you're at the fake dresser, then take a left up the stairs. You'll see him two rooms ahead. Say "agree" to receive [Note to Camin](/item/18088)

2. Go to [Halas](/zone/29) and find [Dargon](/npc/29000) (+350, +350). Buy [Ro's Breath](/item/14330) from her (Approx 800-1200pp).


3. Head to [Erudin](/zone/24) and find [Camin](/npc/24004). He is on the 2nd floor of The Vastly Deep Inn, 1st door on the left. Give Camin Note to Camin. Next, give him 1000pp. Lastly, give him Ro's Breath. I gave him all of these items seperately. He will return a version of Ro's Breath to you that has no charges.

4. Go back to [Halas](/zone/29) and give [Ro's Breath](/item/14330) to [Dargon](/npc/29000). She will despawn and [Arantir Karondor](/npc/29089) will spawn in her place. Hail Arantir Karondor to receive [Arantir's Ring](/item/14334).

5. Go to [Northern Felwithe](/zone/61) and find [Challice](/npc/61012) (-10, -260). She is within the Paladin Guild tunnels in a small room. Give Challice Arantir's Ring and she will give back what appears to be the same item [Arantir's Ring](/item/14335).

6. Go back to [Halas](/zone/29) again and give [Dargon](/npc/29000) [Arantir's Ring](/item/14335) to spawn [Arantir Karondor](/npc/29089). Say "gnome" to Arantir Karondor to receive [Note from Arantir](/item/18169).

7. Go to [Butcherblock](/zone/68) and find [Kandin Firepot](/npc/68109) (-1500, +2840), give him Note from Arantir, then say "oil" to receive [Golem Sprocket](/item/14319).

9. Head over to [Plane of Fear](/zone/72) and look for [a broken golem](/npc/72074). It supposedly has a 3 day respawn (not verified). Give [a broken golem](/npc/72074) your [Golem Sprocket](/item/14319). This will spawn [an enraged golem](/npc/72106). Fire spells and melee land best. Kill an enraged golem and loot [Green Oil](/item/14349).

11. Go back to [Butcherblock](/zone/68). Give [Kandin Firepot](/npc/68109) [Green Oil](/item/14349) to receive [Staff of Gabstik](/item/14339) and [Note to Arantir](/item/18168).

### Part 2: [Blue Crystal Staff](/item/14337) and [Gnarled Staff](/item/14338)

1. Kill [Phinigel Autropos](/npc/64001) in [Kedge Keep](/zone/64). Loot [Blue Crystal Staff](/item/14337). Uncommon Drop. 12 hour respawn.

2. Kill [Venril Sathir](/npc/102010) in [Karnor's Castle](/zone/102). Loot [Gnarled Staff](/item/14338). Uncommon Drop. 3 day respawn.

### Part 3 - Final Turn-Ins

1. Go back to [Everfrost](/zone/30) and give [Dargon](/npc/29000)  Note to Arantir. [Arantir Karondor](/npc/29089) will spawn, give him Staff of Gabstik, Blue Crystal Staff, Gnarled Staff to receive [Magically Sealed Bag](/item/14340).

2. Go back to [Solomen](/npc/80023) in [Temple of Solusek Ro](/zone/80), give him [Magically Sealed Bag](/item/14340) to receive [Staff of the Four](/item/14341)!
