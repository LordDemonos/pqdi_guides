## The Quest

### Step 1

Step 1 can take a long time as the drops are rare.

You'll first need to quest for 3 pieces of Darkforge Armor: [Darkforge Helm](/item/3140), [Darkforge Greaves](/item/3145), and [Darkforge Breastplate](/item/3141). Each item requires multiple drops. Once you have the necessary drops, you'll turn them into [an undead knight](/npc/80001) NPC in [Temple of Solusek Ro](/zone/80) to receive the Armor. There are 2 an undead knight NPC's in the same room, so make sure to hand in your items to the correct one (outlined below).

The resulting Darkforge Armor items are tradable so you can potentially buy them from someone else.

1. [Darkforge Helm](/item/3140) - [Script Page](/script-entities/soltemple/an_undead_knight_)

    - 1x [Decayed Helm](/item/12283)
    - 1x [Decayed Visor](/item/12284)
    - 2x [Damaged Militia Helm](/item/13921)

    - 1x [Decayed Left Legplate](/item/12294)
    - 1x [Decayed Right Legplate](/item/12293)
    - 2x [Melatite](/item/12297)

Turn into an undead knight in Temple of Solusek Ro (South skeleton)

3. [Darkforge Breastplate](/item/3141) - [Script Page](/script-entities/soltemple/an_undead_knight_)

    - 1x [Decayed Breastplate](/item/12285)
    - 1x [Decayed Chainmail](/item/12286)
    - 2x [Enchanted Platinum Bar](/item/16507)

Turn into an undead knight in Temple of Solusek Ro (North skeleton)



### Step 2
[Script Page](/script-entities/overthere/Kurron_Ni)

Head to [The Overthere](/zone/93) and find [Kurron Ni](/npc/93083) (3248.0, 2203.0). He is in town and has a respawn of approx. 4 hours. Give him [Darkforge Helm](/item/3140), [Darkforge Greaves](/item/3145), [Darkforge Breastplate](/item/3141), and 900pp. He will respawn as [Kurron Ni](/npc/93006).  Kill him and loot [Letter to Duriek](/item/18099).  Bring some friends.

### Step 3
[Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Duriek_Bloodpool)

Find [Duriek Bloodpool](/npc/75003) in [Paineel](/zone/75). He is located in a small room overlooking the noob area (906.0, -98.0). Give him [Letter to Duriek](/item/18099). You'll get some faction in return (+3 [Truespirit](/faction/404)). 

### Step 4
[Script Page](/script-entities/neriaka/Smaka)

Go to [Neriak Foreign Quarter](/zone/40). Give 1000pp to [Smaka](/npc/40034) (-334.0, -106.0) to receive [Cough Elixir](/item/14365).

### Step 5
[Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Duriek_Bloodpool)

Go back to [Paineel](/zone/75) and give the [Cough Elixir](/item/14365) to [Duriek Bloodpool](/npc/75003) (+3 [Truespirit](/faction/404)).

### Step 6

Head to [The Hole](/zone/39) and kill [a ratman guard](/npc/39011). Loot [Dusty Tome](/item/14382). 100% drop chance.

The PH is a ratman warrior. Spawns in the jail area (372.0, -87.0). You may need a group.  There are two spawn points on top of each other here - one with an 8 minute timer, the other with an 8 hour timer.

Note: While here you can also do [Step 14](#step-14) (Loot Cell Key from a mimic)

Once you have [Dusty Tome](/item/14382) give it to [Duriek Bloodpool](/npc/75003) back in [Paineel](/zone/75) for some faction (+3 [Truespirit](/faction/404)). ([Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Duriek_Bloodpool))

### Step 7

Go to [Plane of Sky](/zone/71). Kill mobs (any island) until you get a [Blade of Abrogation](/item/5430). Rare drop.

### Step 8

Obtain a [Ghoulbane](/item/5403). You can get one from either:

1. [froglok shin lord](/npc/65128) in [Upper Guk](/zone/65) (15% spawn chance, 25% drop chance). Level 30.

2. [Joren Nobleheart](/npc/62000) in [Southern Felwithe](/zone/62). He is located in through center teleport pad in the back room (736.0, -657.0). Joren Nobleheart is level 60 and is a harder fight of the two (Hits 266+, over 26k HP), but he drops the sword every time. If you've got some help, this is the faster route.

### Step 9

Go to [Plane of Fear](/zone/72). Kill either [Dread](/npc/72000), [Fright](/npc/72004), [Terror](/npc/72002), or [Cazic Thule](/npc/72500). Loot [Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood](/item/11609). Uncommon drop.

### Step 10
[Script Page](/script-entities/qcat/Teydar)

Quest for [Decrepit Sheath](/item/14366).

2. Kill [an ashenbone drake](/item/76002) in [Plane of Hate](/zone/76). Loot [Decrepit Hide](/item/14371). 3% drop chance. These spawn all over the zone as trash mobs.

Head to the [Qeynos Aqueduct System](/zone/45) and find [Teydar](/npc/45044) (338.0, -408.0). The easiest way to get to him is to enter the Catacombs from the Warrior Guildmaster area in [South Qeynos](/zone/1).

Give [Teydar](/npc/45044):

* [Drake Spine](/item/14372)
* [Decrepit Hide](/item/14371)
* [Enchanted Platinum Bar](/item/16507)

to receive [Decrepit Sheath](/item/14366).

### Step 11
[Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Duriek_Bloodpool)

Go back to [Duriek Bloodpool](/npc/75003) in [Paineel](/zone/75). Give him:

### Step 13
[Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Gerot_Kastane)

Go back to [Paineel](/zone/75). You'll need to get to the City area, which means you'll need a key. Get some faction for a key, or bribe a newbie Erudite to open the elevator. Once in the city, find [Gerot Kastane](/npc/75004) (799.0, 671.0) and give him [Seal of Kastane](/item/14375) to receive [Note to Marl](/item/14376). Once obtained, head back to [Marl Kastane](/npc/74001) in [Toxxulia Forest](/zone/38) and give him [Note to Marl](/item/14376). You won't receive an item for this turn in, but you will get faction and a flag to progress the quest. ([Script Page](/script-entities/kerraridge/Marl_Kastane))

He has a long respawn timer so if he isn't up check him every few hours. Give him [Cell Key](/item/14373). He will attack. Additionally another NPC, [Kyrenna](/npc/39155), will also spawn and attack. Kill them both. Loot [Blood of Kyrenna](/item/14381) and [Heart of Kyrenna](/item/14380) from the corpse of Kyrenna. Level 55, bring some friends.

1. Zone in from the "keyed rock" side of Paineel (as opposed to the "dropdown" side)
2. Run through until you see a ramp leading down to a pit filled with a massive construct.
3. At the bottom of the ramp is a doorway with a lamp on each side of it, run through and take an immediate left into the next hallway, then take the first door on the right (next to the red banner on the wall).
4. Run down the two flights of stairs until you get to the next room with 2 doors in it. Take the door straight ahead. The first cubby on the right is the room that Caradon spawns in (421.0, -188.0). an elemental type mob also spawns in the same cubby.

### Step 16
[Script Page](/script-entities/kerraridge/Marl_Kastane)

Go back to [Toxxulia Forest](/zone/38) again. Give [Blood of Kyrenna](/item/14381) to [Marl Kastane](/npc/74001) to receive [Dark Shroud](/item/14377). Then [combine](/recipe/9825) [Heart of Kyrenna](/item/14380) by itself in the [Soulcase](/item/17051) (2 slot container) to create [Heart of the Innocent](/item/14368).

### Step 17
[Script Page](/script-entities/hole/Ghost_of_Glohnor)

Find [Ghost of Glohnor](/npc/39054) at the revenant tower in [The Hole](/zone/39). His PH's are [a fallen erudite](/npc/39164) who spawn in the tombs. Give him [Dark Shroud](/item/14377). [Mummy of Glohnor](/npc/39165) will spawn and attack. Kill it and loot [Head of Glohnor](/item/14378) and [Glohnor Wrappings](/item/14379). Level 56, bring some friends.

### Step 18
[Script Page](/script-entities/paineel/Gerot_Kastane)

Go back to [Gerot Kastane](/npc/75004) in [Paineel](/zone/75) (in town). Give him [Head of Glohnor](/item/14378) to receive [Head of the Valiant](/item/14369).


### Step 19
[Script Page](/script-entities/kerraridge/Marl_Kastane)

Go to [Kerra Isle](/zone/74) and give [Glohnor Wrappings](/item/14379) to [Marl Kastane](/npc/74001) to receive [Will of Innoruuk](/item/14370).

### Step 20
[Script Page](/script-entities/citymist/Lhranc)
Final Fight and Epic!

Head to [City of Mist](/zone/90). Find [Lhranc](/npc/90002) (1.0, 85.0). Give him:

* [Corrupted Ghoulbane](/item/14367)
* [Heart of the Innocent](/item/14368)
* [Head of the Valiant](/item/14369)
* [Will of Innoruuk](/item/14370)

This guy doesn't mess around, so bring **a lot** of friends. Once dead, [Marl Kastane](/npc/90016) will spawn just outside Lhranc's room (1.4, 28.1). 

[Script Page](/script-entities/citymist/%23Marl_Kastane)

>Alas, I cannot be the one to carry the sword back to my people as proof in fear they will kill me to possess it for their own. I think a simple trade is in order. Perhaps you have a symbol or token of Lhanrc's that I could take back to the others to ease their worries?

Give [Marl Kastane](/npc/90016) [Lhranc's Token](/item/14384) 

>Very good, I will go deliver this right away.

to receive [Innoruuk's Curse](/item/14383)!
