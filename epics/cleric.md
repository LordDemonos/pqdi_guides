## Orb of Frozen Water

### Step 1
Go to [Lake Rathetear](/zone/51) and camp [Lord Bergurgle](/npc/51143). He spawns at the top of the tower in an underwater tunnel (2777.0, 159.0). His PH is the middle of the three goblins. Loot [Lord Bergurgle's Crown](/item/28044).  28 min respawn, 5% spawn chance. Always drops.

### Step 2
[Script Page](/script-entities/lakerathe/Shmendrik_Lavawalker)

Head to [Shmendrik Lavawalker](/npc/51012) in [Lake Rathetear](/zone/51). He is located in the North Center of the zone (3614.0, 0.0). Give him [Lord Bergurgle's Crown](/item/28044). In return, you will receive [Oil of Fennin Ro](/item/28045) (not needed for epic). This turn-in also spawns an NPC in the nearby hut (3630.3, 160.0), [Natasha Whitewater](/npc/51138) (don't let her die). She will roam out and attack Shmendrik Lavawalker. Once she attacks him, kill Shmendrik Lavawalker. Upon his death, [a spirit of flame](/npc/51145) will spawn. Kill a spirit of flame and loot [Damaged Goblin Crown](/item/28046). Give the  Damaged Goblin Crown to Natasha Whitewater to receive [Ornate Sea Shell](/item/28047) ([Script Page](/script-entities/lakerathe/%23Natasha_Whitewater) for this turn in).

### Step 4
[Script Page](/script-entities/soltemple/80002)

Head to [Temple of Solusek Ro](/zone/80) and find [a seeker](/npc/80002). There are several in the zone, but the one you are looking for specifically is at (328.0, 39.0). He is in a small room on the 2nd floor. To easily find him, go to the back of the zone, then turn left at the fake dresser and go up the stairs. Spawns at roughly 7am, despawns at roughly 9pm. Make sure to hand it into the Male version only. Do not hand to female version that spawns at night.

Give a seeker the [Coral Statue of Tarew](/item/28051) to spawn [a plasmatic priest](/npc/80042).

### Step 7
[Script Page](/script-entities/burningwood/Naxot_Deepwater)

## Orb of Vapor

### Step 10
[Script Page](/script-entities/soldungb/Zordak_Ragefire)

Go to [Nagafen's Lair](/zone/32) (SolB) and find [Zordak Ragefire](/npc/32038). He is located back in the fire giant area on a ledge underneath a large banner . Give him [Shimmering Pearl](/item/28054) to receive [Zordak's Box of Bindings](/item/17175) and [Swirling Pearl](/item/28059). Zordak Ragefire is currently a 24 hour respawn.

### Step 11
Go to [Skyfire Mountains](/zone/91) and farm 4x [Pearlescent Fragment](/item/24995) from random trash mobs. This can take a while so be patient. Once you have all 4, [combine](/recipe/9647) them in [Zordak's Box of Bindings](/item/17175) to create [An Assembled Pearlescent Shard](/item/24996).

### Step 12
[Script Page](/script-entities/skyfire/Warder_Cecilia)

Give [An Assembled Pearlescent Shard](/item/24996) to [Warder Cecilia](/npc/91037), who is on Northeast side of [Skyfire Mountains](/zone/91). She will give you [Pearlescent Seal](/item/24997) in return and also spawn [Zordak Ragefire](/npc/91005) (human) who needs to be killed. Upon Zordak Ragefire's death, the dragon [Zordakalicus Ragefire](/npc/91006) will spawn. Kill him and loot [Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire](/item/17122) (2 slot container).  Bring some friends.

Use the [Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire](/item/17122) container and [combine](/recipe/10061) [Pearlescent Seal](/item/24997) (from Warden Cecilia in Skyfire Mountains) with [Swirling Pearl](/item/28059) (from Zordak Ragefire in Step 10) to create [Zordak Ragefire's Heart](/item/28019).
