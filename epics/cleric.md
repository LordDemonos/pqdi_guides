To easily find him, go to the back of the zone, then turn left at the fake dresser and go up the stairs. Follow the map below and you'll eventually you stumble into his small room. Spawns at roughly 7am, despawns at roughly 9pm. Make sure to hand it into the Male version only. Do not hand to female version that spawns at night.

Give a seeker the Coral Statue of Tarew to spawn a plasmatic priest. It's best to either kill a plasmatic priest quickly in his room or in the hallway just outside his room.

Give him Shimmering Pearl to receive Zordak's Box of Bindings and Swirling Pearl. Zordak Ragefire is a 24 hour respawn. If he is not up, you can spawn him in an instance.


### Step 11

Give Assembled Pearlescent Shard to Warder Cecilia, who is on Northeast side of Skyfire Mountains. She will give you  Pearlescent Seal in return and also spawn Zordak Ragefire (human) who needs to be killed. Upon Zordak Ragefire's death, the dragon Zordakalicus Ragefire will spawn. Kill him and loot Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire (2 slot container).

**The dragon fears and it would be safest to have at least a group of players to kill him in PoP era. Possibly more if in earlier eras. He is easy but it's always better to have more rather than not enough.**

Use the Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire container and combine Pearlescent Seal (from Warden Cecilia in Skyfire Mountains) with Swirling Pearl (from Zordak Ragefire in Step 3A) to create Zordak Ragefire's Heart.
