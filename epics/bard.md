## Maestro's Symphony Page 25

### Step 10

Go to West Karana and find Maligar (+1250, -10900).  He has some KoS mobs near him that you might need to kill. You will want to charm Maligar because he is KoS. Once charmed, give him Note to Maligar to spawn Maligar's Enraged Doppleganger. Kill Maligar's Enraged Doppleganger (Level 45). Loot Maligar's Head.

PH spawn rates are between 1-2 minutes. They can spawn quite frequently once you find the correct PH. The PH's roam after spawning so you may need to have 2 characters to quickly find the spawn point.

(+1630, -3900) and (+550, -4090) His PH's can roam, so you'll want a character to stand at each of his spawn points while a Bard uses Song of Highsun to send mobs back to their spawn point.
