## Jeb's Seal

### Step 1A
Go to the Qeynos Catacombs and find Reania Jukle (Enchnater Guildmaster) at +390, -390. The easiest way to get to her is to enter the Qeynos Catacombs from the warrior arena area in South Qeynos.
Say "find your own supply" to receive Empty Ink Vial.

### Step 1B
Go to Lower Guk and charm a ghoul scribe. Give him Empty Ink Vial to receive Ink of the Dark. To avoid the other frogs killing him while he's charmed you can mez him first, kill the adds, then charm him afterwards.

### Step1C
Loot Shining Metallic Robes (tradable) from either the ghoul arch magus or from Yendar Starpyre. the ghoul arch magus is a rare spawn in Lower Guk, his PH is a kor ghoul wizard. The Robe is his rare drop. Yendar Starpyre  is a roaming level 65 gnome in Steamfont Mountains. He always drops the robe. If you have a few friends to help, it's easier to kill Yendar Starpyre. The robe is tradable as well, so check the Bazaar.

### Step 1D
Give Shining Metallic Robes to Rilgor Plegnog (Enchanter Guildmaster) in the north area of Ak'Anon to receive Mechanical Pen. You can use "Find" to locate him.


### Step 1E
Purchase   Quill and   Piece of Parchment from a vendor. The vendor I used was Hanlore Escaval (+300, -570) in South Qeynos.

Give both  Quill and   Piece of Parchment to Chrislin Baker in West Karana. She is located inside a hut. She will despawn and give you a bandit sash, which is not used for this quest. However, this turn-in also triggers Thrackin Griften ( +860, -11570) to spawn across the zone. Kill him and loot White Paper.

Thrackin Griften is level 55, 20K HP, Hits 150+, and somewhat resistant to spells.

### Step 1F
Go to Erudin and find Stofo Olan. He is inside the Vastly Deep Inn on the 2nd floor, last door on the right. Give him Ink of the Dark, Mechanical Pen,   White Paper to receive Copy of Notes.

### Step 1G
Go to Burning Woods and find a sarnak imitator (-1200, -4000). Give him  Copy of Notes to receive Jeb's Seal.

## First Piece of Staff

### Step 2A
Go to East Cabilis and kill Vessel Drozlin. Loot Xolion Rod. He is located in the sewers. In order to access the sewers you need to run through the red glowing wall in the Shaman Guild Master area, then go down a series of ladders. Make sure you have levitate as well. When you get to the 4 way cross-road, take the right path and levitate across the pit. He can run at low hp so the best strat is to pull him into the nearby water so that he does not path back through the 1-way hidden walls when he runs.
- Level 60
- Hits 300+
- 18K HP
- Fairly Resistant to spells

### Step 2B
Go to Neriak Third Gate and kill Verina Tomb. Loot Innoruuk's Word. She spawns in the Cleric Guild Master area in the first section of the zone.

### Step 2C
Go to Chardok and kill Prince Selrach Di'Zok. Loot Head of a Prince. Respawn time 2 hours. Level 61. A group of PoP geared players should be able to kill him with ease. You'll need a picklock to open his door.

Find Joren Nobleheart in Southern Felwithe. In the teleport pad room, take the one straight ahead. Give him Head of a Prince to receive Chalice of Kings.

### Step 2D
Go to Oggok. Look for the ground spawn Large Muddy Sandals at +220, +370. Next, find Bozlum Blossom (in Oggok) and give her the Large Muddy Sandals to receive Scribbled Parchment.

Find Brokk Boxtripper, who is right next to where you just picked up the ground spawn. Give him
Scribbled Parchment to receive Gift to Bozlum. Go back to Bozlum Blossom and give her Gift to Bozlum to receive Snow Blossoms.

### Step 2E
Go to The Overthere and find Modani Qu`Loni. He is located in an underground tunnel in the Gorge. Give him  Jeb's Seal. He will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive  Enchanters Sack.

Combine  Xolion Rod,  Innoruuk's Word,  Chalice of Kings,  Snow Blossoms in Enchanters Sack to receive  Sack for Modani. Give Modani Qu`Loni  Sack for Modani to receive  1st Piece of Staff.

## Second Piece of Staff

### Step 3A
Go to South Ro and Kill Cazel. Loot Spoon. Always Drops. He roams all around the desert area of the zone. He has a high regeneration rate, but is an easy kill with a few people in era. Hits for 200's.

### Step 3B
Go to The Overthere and pick up the ground spawn The One Key. You'll need levitate as it's located on a small plateu coming out of the canyon.

### Step 3C
Go to Dalnir and find the ground spawn  Lost Scroll. Getting there is a bit tricky if you are not familiar with the zone, you'll need to drop down a tomb and go through a fake wall.

### Step 3D
Head to Quest Island in Plane of Sky. In the corner of the room on a table you'll find the ground spawn Charm and Sacrifice.

### Step 3E
Head to Ak'anon and find Clockwork VIIX in the North area of the zone. Give him  Jeb's Seal. He will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive  Enchanters Sack.

Combine  Spoon,  The One Key,  Lost Scroll,  Charm and Sacrifice in Enchanters Sack to create Sack for Mizzle

Give  Clockwork VIIX  Sack for Mizzle to receive 2nd Piece of Staff.

## Third Piece of Staff

### Step 4A
Find Nadia Starfeast in Fironia Vie.  Give her Jeb's Seal. She will hand it back. Say the following to get four different gems:

* `diamond`
* `sapphire`
* `emerald`
* `ruby`

You'll receive Dull Diamond, Dull Sapphire, Dull Emerald, Dull Ruby. You'll need to charm various mobs and turn them in to receive the "Enchanted" versions.

### Step 4B
Head to Kaesora and find spectral librarian. Charm him and give him Dull Diamond to receive Enchanted Diamond.

Kill mobs on the ground floor of the library until he spawns. I have also personally seen mobs despawn on their own and spectral librarian spawn in their place, so he seems to have more than one method of spawning.  PH's can be Guardian of Xalgoz and tortured librarian.

### Step 4C
Go to Skyfire Mountains and find Felia Goldwing. Her PH can be any of the named in the zone. She is a rare spawn. A tracker is recommended. Charm her and give her Dull Sapphire to receive Enchanted Sapphire.

PH's:

* a lava walker (wyvern version)
* a shadow drake
* a soul devourer
* a wandering wurm
* a wurm spirit
* Black Scar
* Faerie of Dismay
* Guardian of Felia

### Step 4D
Go to The Overthere and find Impaler Tzilug. 24 hour respawn. No PH. He is in the canyon tunnels. Charm him and give him Dull Emerald to receive Enchanted Emerald.

### Step 4E
Go to City of Mist and find Wraith of Jaxion. He spawns at the very end of the floating islands. You'll need a pick lock to get through some of the locked doors. His PH circles around the building. Respawn 16 minutes. Charm him and give him Dull Ruby to receive Enchanted Ruby.

### Step 4F
Go back to Nadia Starfeast in Fironia Vie. Kunark - Gates servers you can find her in the out on the port/dock. Omens+ servers can find her on the east side of the zone. Give her Jeb's Seal. She will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive  Enchanters Sack.

Combine  Enchanted Emerald,  Enchanted Ruby,  Enchanted Sapphire, Enchanted Diamond  in Enchanters Sack to create Sack for Nadia.

Give Nadia Starfeast  Sack for Nadia to receive 3rd Piece of Staff

## Fourth Piece of Staff

### Step 5A
Go to Plane of Fear and kill Wraith of a Shissar. It is located at the top of the large temple inside the fire ring. As of 2/17/21 patch she will spawn 9 hours after being killed, and 5-14 after a zone or server reset. No PH. Loot Head of the Serpent.

### Step 5B
Go to Plane of Hate and kill a forsaken revenant. Loot Essence of a Vampire. Rare drop. These mobs are spread all over the zone. Both male and females are known to drop it.

### Step 5C
Go to Field of Bone and kill The Tangrin. Loot Sands of the Mystics. It is located on an island at the north side of the zone.  Level 54.  Hits 230. Estimated 32K HP. Respawn estimated 12 hours.

### Step 5D
Go to The Hole and kill the Ghost of Kindle. Loot Essence of a Ghost. Level 50.

Depending on  what expansion your server is on you may find her at different locations. The Hole 1.0 spot isn't confirmed but she may be in the Undead Tower (see map). If not, then you'll find her in the Hole 2.0 version spot.

### Step 5E
In The Hole you'll find Polzin Mrid.


1. Give him Jeb's Seal. He will hand it back. Then say "I need a sack" to receive  Enchanters Sack.

2. Combine Head of the Serpent,  Essence of a Vampire, Sands of the Mystics, Essence of a Ghost to create Sack for Polzin.

3. Give Polzin Mrid Sack for Polzin to receive 4th Piece of Staff.

4. Before you leave, get an extra Enchanters Sack from Polzin Mrid and use it to combine 1st Piece of Staff, 2nd Piece of Staff, 3rd Piece of Staff, 4th Piece of Staff to create Bundle of Staves.

## Final Turn In

Go back to Burning Woods and find a sarnak imitator (-1200, -4000). Give him Bundle of Staves to receive Staff of the Serpent!
