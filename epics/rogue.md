## Pre-Farmable Items:
* Stained Parchment Top
* Stained Parchment Bottom
* Book of Souls
* 2 x Bottle of Milk
* 100pp
* Step 6 - 4 Robes
* Step 8 - 4 Weapons

### Stained Parchment Top
You will need some pick pocketing skill. 190 confirmed working.

Head to North Kaladim and pickpocket the dwarven Rogue Guildmaster Founy Jestands until you receive Stained Parchment Top. He will not always have it on him so your strategy here is going to be to pickpocket him until you get roughly 20 fails in a row (assuming your skill is high). Usually you'll get platinum/gold and some other miscellaneous items. Once you think he has no more items on him, come back an hour or two later and repeat the process until you get Stained Parchment Top.

If he aggros on you, just zone over into South Kaladim. He supposedly re-spawns once a day (in game time), but I have not verified the exact time at which this happens.  Also, if you are an evil race, it's helpful to have an illusion mask for a good race so you aren't KoS. Uncommon Drop.

### Stained Parchment Bottom
You will need some pick pocketing skill. 190 confirmed working.

The same strategy applies here. Pickpocket Tani N`Mar in Neriak Third Gate until you feel he has nothing left, then come back an hour or two later and repeat the process until you get Stained Parchment Bottom. If he aggros be ready for a long run back to the zone in. It is recommended to stand on the steps behind him while pick pocketing. Having a Dark Elf illusion mask is benefical here as well if you are KoS to Dark Elves. Uncommon Drop. 

### Book of Souls
This can be found in Plane of Hate. It is a ground spawn at +171, -326 on top of a dresser. Roughly 10 hour re-spawn. You can sneak/hide to it. SoS is not required. The building it's in is directly across from the Maestro Castle front entrance.

### 2 x Bottle of Milk
Buy 2 x Bottle of Milk from a Baking Vendor.  Don't drink them!

## The Quest

### Step 1
Now we can begin the quest. Head to Highpass Hold and speak to Anson McBale. He is in a hidden area of the zone that is only accessible by an underwater tunnel (See Map). He is also not always up and may need to be spawned. His PH is a specific a smuggler located at +34, +327. Anson McBale spawns approx 13.5 min after the PH is killed. It may take a few PH's to spawn him.

Say `I need to see Stanos` to  Anson McBale to spawn Stanos Herkanor. Give Stanos Herkanor Stained Parchment Top and Stained Parchment Bottom to receive   Combined Parchment.

### Step 2
Head to Lake Rathetear and find Eldreth (+2621, -556). Give him Combined Parchment, 2x Bottle of Milk, and 100pp to receive Scribbled Parchment. 

### Step 3
1. Head to Steamfont Mountains and find Yendar Starpyre, who roams all over the zone.  A tracker would help.

2. Give Yendar Starpyre Scribbled Parchment to receive Tattered Parchment.

3. Next give Yendar Starpyre the  Book of Souls along with the Tattered Parchment you just got. This depawns Yendar Starpyre and spawns Renux Herkanor (level 50). Kill her. Loot Translated Parchment.

### Step 4
Head back to Highpass Hold and give  Translated Parchment to Stanos Herkanor to receive Sealed Box.  

### Step 5
Go to Kithicor Forest. Give the Sealed Box to any of the Dark Elves at the Cabin Ruins to spawn General V`ghera. These mobs only spawn at night. He hits fairly fast and everything in the cabin will assist when he's pulled. Bring a lot of friends.

Once he's dead, loot General's Pouch.

### Step 6
Collect these 4 robes:

* Robe of the Kedge
* Robe of the Ishva (tradable)
* Shining Metallic Robe (tradable)
* Robe of the Oracle (tradable)

### Step 7
Head to West Karana and find Vilnius the Small. He is a Barbarian on a small hill that spawns at night. A brigand takes his place during the day. You do not need to kill the brigand. It will despawn at night and Vilnius the Small will take his place a few (in game) hours later.

Give Vilnius the Small Robe of the Kedge, Robe of the Ishva, Shining Metallic Robe, and Robe of the Oracle to receive Cazic Quill.

### Step 8
Collect these 4 items:

* Fleshripper
* Painbringer
* Gigantic Zweihander (tradable)
* A Mithril Two-Handed Sword (tradable)

Give all 4 items to Vilnius the Small in West Karana to receive Jagged Diamond Dagger. See Step 7 for how to spawn him.

### Step 9
Go back to Highpass Hold and spawn Stanos Herkanor for a final time. Say `I need to see Stanos` to Anson McBale if Stanos Herkanor is not already up.

Give him:

* Cazic Quill
* General's Pouch
* Jagged Diamond Dagger

Receive Ragebringer!
